Revision history for Perl extension Silly::StringMaths.

*** 0.12 (14th July 1998)

Renamed Silly::StringMaths (it was previously tentatively entitled
Math::Strings), and exporter support added. (I don't tend to like the
exporter mechanism, but the interface is otherwise extremely clunky.)

*** 0.11 (10th July 1998)

Slight modification made to the divide routine to allow the cunning

	$divisor =~ s%.%.%g;
	$base="A"x($base =~ s%$divisor%%g);

(which is why I wrote this in the first place)


*** 0.10 (9th July 1998)

Original version - support for the four basic operators
(add, subtract, multiply, divide), plus exponentiate, 
and the useful functions sign, negative and invert.
